Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:

 1. Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon. This means no text-only top-level comments.

 2. It must be an original cartoon. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no AI generated images, no templates, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation.

 3. Each top-level comment should only have a maximum of 3 cartoons. 

That's all. Enjoy your weekend!",2022-12-17 20:40:29

Feel free to share political cartoons in this thread. Besides our usual civility policy, there are three rules to follow:

 1. Every top-level comment must contain a political cartoon. This means no text-only top-level comments.

 2. It must be an original cartoon. This means no photographs, no edited cartoons, no AI generated images, no templates, no memes and no image macros. OC is allowed, as is animation.

 3. Each top-level comment should only have a maximum of 3 cartoons.

Yes. Congress acts as the court in this case and several others (such as impeachment) in the Constitution. Turning this over to the courts would dismantle the Congressional check that is supposed to be happening here. The ultimate safeguard against a President or SCOTUS that is harmful to the nation is Congress. The ultimate safeguard against a Congress that is harmful to the nation is the SCOTUS.

Meanwhile the President has significant powers to reign in both the SCOTUS and Congress, but cannot directly remove either.

> Kind of sets an extremely dangerous precedent

Not at all. The Constitution very much wants to err on the side of preventing dangerous Presidents from serving. There are over 300 million people in the US, about half of whom are eligible and a sizable number of whom are competent to serve as President. Allowing Congress to bar one of them form office because of an attempt to overthrow the government is not significantly altering the playing field.

If Congress went off the rails and started barring potential candidates willy-nilly, I would expect the voters to take action (the ultimate check against all elected officials).",2022-12-18 05:42:31

Comment,1,j0o4uho,,0,1671334750.0,"> but believing fraud is being perpetrated against you isn’t exactly a defense against committing these crimes. 

Unfortunately in the case of Georgia's ""solicitation to commit election fraud"" law, this *is* a defense.  The prosecution must prove that Trump's intention was to have Raffensberger commit a crime.  If Trump's defense can persuade that Trump believed what he said --that he was asking Raffensberger to investigate and find fraudulent votes he genuinely believed existed--then Trump was not soliciting a crime and therefore was not guilty (of that particular crime: we all know the fucker is guilty of a lot of other shit).  


> It’s not okay to commit crimes just because other people are committing crimes.   

Of course.  But from the standpoint of Georgia law, *if he believed he was asking Raffensberger to do something legal*, the he did not commit a crime in the first place.  

Don't shoot me, I'm just the guy trying to read up on these laws.  I'm not trying to defend Trump, I'm trying to understand the legal complications faced by the prosecution.

I’m not sure what you mean with that second paragraph. If you are saying that I should be fine with termination if I see it as murder, I wonder if you would say the same. That would be the equivalent of saying that we should legalize any murder. Abortion (premeditated, just clarifying to prevent the ectopic pregnancy gotcha) is 100% murder and shouldn’t be treated any different that murdering a 6 month old baby out of the womb.

In the rare instance that the woman became pregnant not by her own poor decisions but by force (rape), I would give her as much support as possible and love and care for her for all the trauma she went through, but I don’t see how you can justify murder by it.

Then the deal was pulled by the WH. 

Also, Democrats are more than willing to compromise. Who do you see having press conferences jumpstarting conversations and urging the need to work on immigration compromise? Sen Durbin has been trying to do something for 20+ yrs. On the opposite end you have the GOP threatening to jail the DHS chief, instantly pour cold water over a bipartisan framework (i.e. John Cornyn), shutting the door on anything bipartisan, saying ""my way or the highway."" These two are just not the same. 

About your specific points that need to be implemented, almost all of them (e verify, border security, etc) were in the 2013 gang of 8 bill. GOP controlled house did not take it up at all.

A few years ago I got a conservative spam email listing all of the threats in recent decades that were supposed to have put the fate of the world at risk. Global warming! Mass extinctions! Nuclear war! Pollution! Deforestation! Inequality! Famine! Deadly diseases!

I laugh whenever I think of this, as an example of people *almost* getting the point.

It should be fact based. The fact is, crack has to be manufactured by a human in processes beyond what cocaine is.

Moving the goalposts of Justice based on who is using what drugs isn’t congruent with the idea that individuals who are actively purposely doing more processes or supporting more processes that are illegal should be punished more than those that don’t (murder vs premeditated murder for example)

No, the recommendation doesn't carry any real weight. But think of it as a mix of a summary/introduction to the report and a way to apply political pressure to the DOJ, and mostly the former. It's a thesis statement. ""This is the point of what we're handing to you.""

The actual useful part of it is aaaaaaaaaaaaall the evidence and testimony they gathered that they're handing the DOJ along with it. That's not nothin'.

Doesn't mean the DOJ is gonna follow through. But it does mean that the committee's work hasn't been nearly as pointless as people tend to think.

Unfortunately, no.  They have to prove that Trump had *criminal intent* and knowingly asked Raffensberger to commit a crime.  If Trump genuinely believed what he *said*--that there were fraudulent votes, and that he was asking to Raffensberger find enough of the fraudulent votes to prove he won--then he was not guilty of Georgia's ""solicitation to commit election fraud"" crime.  

The problem is that *believing crazy conspiracy theories that stroke his ego* is kind of Trump's thing.  Fortunately for us, lying is Trump's other thing.  Much of the trial will center around discerning whether Trump was lying or deluded.  Which pretty much sums up what all of us were doing 2016-2020.",2022-12-18 05:18:08

Comment,1,j0o14ck,,0,1671332837.0,"""Criminal referral"" is my new pet peeve headline, which cable news is completely jacked about.

A criminal referral is simply the notification to a law enforcement or investigative agency that evidence of a crime may exist, and that they should investigate.  There are times when that is critical and there are times when it is nothing but symbolic.  We all know that this investigation is already happening, so this referral moves nothing forward.

But the committee really has no choice, because if they **don't** do the referral, then that could be interpreted (in the media, and by politicos) as a suggestion that the committee doesn't think a criminal investigation is warranted.

OK, fine.  So they do it, and it means nothing.  Why do I care?  Because it's yet another opportunity for the media to get all hysterical about another ""historic"" move.

But they lose focus on what the truly historical event was:  Donald Trump was a historically bad President, who committed historically serious crimes.  And everything that was caused by that is, by definition, historic.  And because ""historic"" happenings give people a reason to watch the news, the media plays is up.

And it's annoying as hell.  More than that, it gives American who want to see the rule of law fairly applied hope that this referral is bringing us closer to judgement day, and it's not.

It doesn't mean judgement day won't come.  Maybe it will.  Just not any faster because of the referral.",2022-12-18 05:07:17

And all of the criticisms that economists had towards those tariffs can equally be applied to Biden’s tariffs on EVs and chips which were imposed under the guise of “national security”. 

“Scholars warned that the Trump administration's use of ""national security"" rationales[95] (these have not been commonly used by past administrations) for the tariffs could undermine the international trading order, as other states could use the same rationales for their own tariffs.”

You would need to  get clear on the difference between ""repression"" and ""oppression""   if you are going to understand what I'm saying.

Look up the definitions. Repression is not inherently a bad thing---actually some repression is necessary for any civil society; ""oppression"" is by definition a bad thing.

If you get clear on that, you might understand that what I'm saying and maybe acknowledge that the phrase uses such a charged word in order to justify repression.

Katie Porter talked about (and this is a direct paraphrase) people falsely accusing others of grooming and pedophila due to their identity (as gay or trans).

Conservatives don't give a shit about you until you reach ""military age"". Then they think you are just fine. Just what they've been looking for. Conservatives want live babies so they can raise them to be dead soldiers. Pro-life... pro-life... These people aren't pro-life, they're killing doctors! What kind of pro-life is that? What, they'll do anything they can to save a fetus but if it grows up to be a doctor they just might have to kill it? They're not pro-life. You know what they are? They're anti-woman.

Comment,1,j0nx9ns,,0,1671330913.0,"I'll tell you a story.  Had a coworker who listen to Joe Rogan a ton.  He came in one day going on about one of the Weinstein's being on and giving like 4 or 5 sciency sounding reasons why COVID was made in a lab.

&#x200B;

I was bored and figured, why not I'll bite.  So I started trying to verify any of the claims that my coworker had heard.  My thoughts going in were the old standby of ""The quickest way to get the answer to something is to post the wrong answer.  Not ask for the right answer."".  Figured there must be some information refuting what was said.

&#x200B;

Well I didn't find a damn thing from anywhere pushing back on what was said.  Its entirely possible that the statements the guy made were 100% true but also 100% normal.  I know jack shit about how a virus is composed.  So something that sounds super interesting might be the same as me touting a car cause it has a gas pedal.  

&#x200B;

My point basically, and I bet you do this a lot in your life.  When you hear something that you're skeptical about.  The first instinct is to go find something that refutes what you just heard.  Where the problem occurs is what we do when we don't find that pushback.  I didn't find pushback about what that guy had said on Rogan.  But that itself wasn't enough for me to just assume it was accurate info and relevant info.  My coworker on the other hand said that that meant the guy must have been right since no one came out to challenge what was said.

&#x200B;

If the first time someone hears Nick Fuentes and his rubbish.  They immediately see massive pushback on the positions he takes and examples of why its messed up.  They probably won't get sucked in to his nazi crap.  But if you wait until the 20th time to try to show someone why its messed up.

No.

Liberals would *like* to believe Trump is going to jail, but they are well aware of what the reality is. So they would to *like* believe, but *do not* believe that Trump is going to jail.

Qnuts and other Maga fauna would like to believe things, and so they simply do so. Evidence is secondary and only evidence that supports their delusion is accepted. When no evidence actually exists they simply make it up.
